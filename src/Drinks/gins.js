    name: 'Cambridge Dry',
    description: 'Cambridge Distillery is a small distillery based in Cambridge, England and is owned and run by Will and Lucy Lowe. The distillery specializes in seasonal gins and tailored gins - custom made gins created for individuals and groups based on their personal tastes. However, the distillery has recently released its own flagship expression, Cambridge Dry Gin. This gin is made with eight botanicals: Macedonian juniper, blackcurrant leaf, basil, rosemary, lemon verbena, rose petals, violet petals, and angelica. Each botanical is infused and distilled individually with small batches of the spirit. The final product is then bottled at 42% ABV.',

    name: 'Monkey 47',
    description: 'Hailing from Germany’s Black Forest, Monkey 47 is an exotic gin made with a molasses base. The 47 refers to the number of botanicals used which includes such unlikely fruit ingredients like lingonberries, blackberries, and honey pomelo. These are combined with a host of recognizable gin botanicals such as chamomile, sage, angelica, coriander, and a whole array of others. Another anomaly at Monkey 47 is that the distillate is aged in earthenware containers for three months before being brought to 47% ABV with the forest’s celebrated water.',
